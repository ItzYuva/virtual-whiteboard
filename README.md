# Virtual-whiteboard
**Overview --**
--> Virtual Whiteboard is an interactive and dynamic solution designed to simulate a traditional whiteboard in a virtual environment. 
--> Built using OpenCV and Python, this project leverages computer vision techniques to create an intuitive, marker-free drawing experience. 
--> It enables users to draw, erase, and annotate directly on a digital canvas, making it perfect for educational, brainstorming, or collaborative purposes.

**Key Features --**
--> **Gesture-Based Drawing**: Draw and annotate on the whiteboard using hand gestures or an object as a marker.
--> **Erasing and Clearing**: Clear specific sections or the entire whiteboard easily.
--> **Color Customization**: Change brush colors for versatile drawing options.
--> **Real-Time Interaction**: Low latency and smooth performance for a seamless user experience.
--> **Lightweight and User-Friendly**: Minimal setup with an easy-to-use interface.

**Technologies Used --**
**Programming Language**: Python
**Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy
**Tools**: Any webcam-enabled device

**Use Cases --**
**Education**: Enhance online teaching by simulating a physical whiteboard.
**Collaborations**: Use during brainstorming sessions or meetings.
**Creative Work**: Sketch and draw ideas digitally without additional hardware.

Work left to add in this project:
1. Add a feature to select any file with hand gesture.
2. Add a feature to control ppt with hand gesture.
